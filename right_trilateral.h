/**
 * RIGHT_TRILATERAL is a class which inherits the protected and public data
 * attributes and methods of TRILATERAL.
 * 
 * A RIGHT_TRILATERAL object represents an instance in which three unique POINT instances exist 
 * such that each one of those three POINT instances represents a unique coordinate pair within the tuple of three POINT instances 
 * (such that each coordinate pair represents exactly one two-dimensional point, POINT(X,Y), on a Cartesian grid) and
 * such that exactly one interior angle of the triangle which that RIGHT_TRILATERAL object represents is 90 degrees.
 * 
 * Each RIGHT_TRILATERAL object represents a specific three-sided polygon whose area is a positive real number.
 * 
 * (A synonym for "trilateral" is "triangle").
 * 
 * Class members which are set to the protected access specifier
 * are accessible to the base class and to derived classes.
 * 
 * Class members which are set to the private access specifier
 * are only accessible to the base class.
 * 
 * Class members which are set to the public access specifier
 * are accessible to any scope within the program where
 * the base class and its derived classes are implemented.
