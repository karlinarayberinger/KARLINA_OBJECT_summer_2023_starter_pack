 * Define a class which is used to instantiate POINT type objects.

 * (An object is a variable whose data type is user defined rather than native to the C++ programming language).
 * 
 * A POINT object represents a whole number coordinate pair in the form (X,Y).
 * 
 * X represents a specific whole number position along the x-axis (i.e. horizontal dimension) of a two-dimensional Cartesian grid.
 * Y represents a specific whole number position along the y-axis (i.e. vertical dimension) of the same two-dimensional Cartesian grid.
 * 
 * X stores one integer value at a time which is no smaller than MINIMUM_X and which is no larger than MAXIMUM_X.
 * Y stores one integer value at a time which is no smaller than MINIMUM_Y and which is no larger than MAXIMUM_Y.
