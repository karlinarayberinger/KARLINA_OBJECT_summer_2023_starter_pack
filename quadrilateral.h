 * QUADRILATERAL is a class which inherits the protected and public data
 * attributes and methods of POLYGON (and POLYGON is an abstract class).
 * 
 * A QUADRILATERAL object represents an instance in which four unique POINT instances exist 
 * such that each one of those four POINT instances represents a unique coordinate pair within the tuple of four POINT instances 
 * (such that each coordinate pair represents exactly one two-dimensional point, POINT(X,Y), on a Cartesian grid).
 * 
 * Each QUADRILATERAL object represents a specific four-sided polygon whose area is a positive real number.
 * 
 * Class members which are set to the protected access specifier
 * are accessible to the base class and to derived classes.
 * 
 * Class members which are set to the private access specifier
 * are only accessible to the base class.
 * 
 * Class members which are set to the public access specifier
 * are accessible to any scope within the program where
 * the base class and its derived classes are implemented.
